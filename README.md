This is a simple script for downloading contents of issue tracker from github.

It downloads issues and embedded images and saves them as markdown files.

Note that it was created as just-in-case backup. It saves only part of data and will not be sufficient to loslessly recreate everything.

Also, potential restoration is not coded or tested.

On the other hand downloaded data is human readable.

# Installation

To install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# History

Based on code from [https://github.com/mhl/github-issues-scripts](https://github.com/mhl/github-issues-scripts), rewritten to Python 3 and limited to generation of markdown files.

Original created pdf and was later extended to have more functionality.
